Use case for the LWRS M3 milestone due September 30th 2022
Goal: highlight the potential of the synfuel application for the existing fleet of LWRs
Single comparative NPV case study: Braidwood nuclear power plant in the PJM market
Cases to run, analyzing the influence of electricity pricing, synfuel products pricing, economies of scale: 
- baseline_elec: LWR, PJM LMP for electricity prices; sets the reference NPV
- baseline_low: LWR, NPP O&M for electricity prices (~$25/MWh)
- baseline_high: LWR. regulated market for electricity prices (~$50/MWh)
- synfuel_low: LWR, 400 MW FT+HTSE, EIA projections for synfuel prices
- synfuel_med: LWR, 400 MW FT+HTSE, EIA x3
- synfuel_high: LWR, 400 MW FT+HTSE, EIA x5
- plant_cap_low: LWR, 100 MW HTSE+FT, EIA x3, PJM LMP
- plant_cap_med: LWR, 400 MW HTSE+FT, EIA x3, PJM LMP
- plant_cap_high: LWR, 1000 MW HTSE+FT, EIA x3, PJM LMP
